[*Application Manual*](https://www.microcrystal.com/fileadmin/Media/Products/RTC/App.Manual/RV-3028-C7_App-Manual.pdf)

The RV-3028-C7 is an extremely precise, extremely low power, highly configurable RTC. Under ideal conditions it runs at approximately 40nA with +/-5ppm per year of deviation (+/- 160 seconds worst case per year).
This RV-3028-C7 library was originally forked from the [Sparkfun RV-1805 library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RV-1805_Arduino_Library)

This library allows the user to:

* Set time using hard numbers or the BUILD_TIME from the Arduino compiler
* Read time
* Configure various aspects of the RTC including setting of alarms, interrupts, and wave outputs

Examples are included to get you started
